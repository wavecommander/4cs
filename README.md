## Four Clover Scraper

Minimal thread image scraper.

Made pretty fast with async.

Not well tested or fleshed out, just a little script.

### Usage
Set `EXPORT_PATH` constant in `main.py`

Pass in a list thread URLs as args, or run the script and input a list of thread URLs.

Example: `python3 main.py "https://thatoneimageboard.org/g/thread/87653295" "https://thatoneimageboard.org/g/thread/87675605"`
